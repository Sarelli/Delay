# Delay by Sarelli (2018)
Basic Audio Delay developed in JUCE (C++).
The delay can work both as a stand alone and as a plugin. Stand alone feature downloadable upon request.

This was one of my uni assignments, feel free to download it and use it. Its main purpose on here is to show my coding skills.
